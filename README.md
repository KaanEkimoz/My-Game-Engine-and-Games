MonoGame is a simple and powerful .NET framework for creating games for desktop PCs, video game consoles, and mobile devices using the C# programming language.

This repository contains an Engine folder to create new games faster using common codes and four example games when i create in learning phase. All of them bug-free and works only with code.
 
 # First Game: Painter
 The goal of Painter is to collect paint of three colors: red, green, and blue, falling from the sky in cans supported by balloons. Player can change a can's color by shooting balls at it using the R, G, and B keys, and by left-clicking on the screen. Correctly colored cans earn 10 points while incorrectly colored ones result in a life loss. Lives remaining are displayed in the top-left corner.
 
 # Second Game: Jewel Jam
 Jewel Jam is a puzzle game where players must find specific combinations of jewels in a grid. The grid consists of ten rows and five columns, each containing random jewels with different colors (red, blue, or yellow), shapes (diamond, sphere, or ellipse), and numbers (one, two, or three). Valid combinations consist of three jewels where each property is either the same for all or different for all. Players can shift rows using arrow keys and shift jewels within a row using left and right arrow keys to create valid combinations in the middle column. Pressing spacebar removes valid combinations, causing remaining jewels to fall and new ones to fill the column. Extra points are awarded for multiple combinations made simultaneously. A moving jewel cart indicates remaining time, and creating combinations moves the cart back, extending playtime. The objective is to score as many points as possible before time runs out.
 
 # Third Game: Penguin Pairs
 Penguin Pairs is a puzzle game where players aim to match pairs of penguins of the same color. Clicking on a penguin allows players to select a direction for it to move. Penguins will continue moving until they encounter another object, like another penguin, seal, shark, or iceberg. Falling off the playing field leads to the penguin meeting hungry sharks in the icy water. New gameplay elements include special penguins that match with any color, holes for penguins to get stuck in, and sharks directly on the playing field.
 
 # Fourth Game: Tick Tick
 Tick Tick revolves around a slightly stressed out bomb that is going to explode within 30 s. This means that each level in the game should be finished within 30 s. Under the player’s control, the bomb can walk and jump its way through a level. Each level contains a number of water drops. The bomb should collect all of these water drops and reach the finish panel in time. Throughout the game, we’ll introduce several enemies and other hazards to make things more difficult for the player.
